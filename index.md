## Changes in Global Temperature

This project is brought to you by Group V. This website hosts graphs and maps that visually represent the changes in global temperature from 1743 to 2013. We seek to demonstrate the extent of global warming and illustrate the seriousness of that problem.

### Global Map <a name="Global Map"></a>

This part contains two global maps that describe the changes in temperatures of all countries in Celcius unit.

Above is an interactive map that plots the differences in average temperatures of two period: 1743 to 1975 and 1975 to 2013.

We choose 1975 to be the threshhold because the idea of global warming was first coined in 1975.

As the map above shows, average global temperatures after 1975 are much higher in all countries than the average temperatures before 1975.

The GIF above animatedly shows the changes in average temperatures. The legend in the bottom represents the differences of average temperature in one year compared to that of last year.

As it shows, temperatures of each country increase annually; in some countries, such as Canada, the extent of increasing temperatures are especially significant.

### Comparative Changes (Countries) <a name="Comparative Changes (Countries)"></a>

The following two plots are showing the Average temperature change in different months within cities of two different countries from year 1903~2003 (China & the U.S.).

<iframe src="us_temp.jpg" height="600px" width="100%" style="border:none;"></iframe>

For average temperature in 1903 in China, from June to August, the average temperature are the highest amoung other months throughout the year, and January and December got the lowest average temperaturse.

In 2003, the ranges of temperature in each months does not change too much and the average temperature raised a bit in July but not very much.

For average temperature in 1903 in the US, June and July got the highest average temperature which ranges from 15 to 26 degree. January got the lowest average temperature around -10 to 20 degree. In year 2003, the average temperature in the US raised a bit but not significant.

The following two plots are showing the average temperatures from year 1983 to 2013 in China and the U.S.

<iframe src="us_temp_change.jpg" height="600px" width="100%" style="border:none;"></iframe>

The average temperature plots of two countries both have an increasing trend from year 1984 to 2013 and reaches their perspective maximum average temperature at 2013: around 15 degrees in China and 16.7 degress in the U.S.

The following two boxplots are showing the average temperatures of the two countries (China and the U.S.) in forty years from 1963 to 2003. Changes are not significant.

The following two diagrams are showing eight cities in China and eight states in the U.S. We selected eight representative cities/states based on their unique locations to each perspective country.

<iframe src="us_8_cities.jpg" height="600px" width="100%" style="border:none;"></iframe>

Generally speaking, both cities in China and States in the US have an increasing trend of average temperature from 1913 to 2013. We selected representative cities that located in different direction of each country (South, North, center, near the ocean, etc) .
