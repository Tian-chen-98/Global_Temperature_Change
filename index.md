## Changes in Global Temperature

This project is brought to you by Group V. This website hosts graphs and maps that visually represent the changes in global temperature from 1743 to 2013. We seek to demonstrate the extent of global warming and illustrate the seriousness of that problem.

### Global Map <a name="Global Map"></a>

This part contains two global maps that describe the changes in temperatures of all countries in Celcius unit.

Above is an interactive map that plots the differences in average temperatures of two period: 1743 to 1975 and 1975 to 2013.

We choose 1975 to be the threshhold because the idea of global warming was first coined in 1975.

As the map above shows, average global temperatures after 1975 are much higher in all countries than the average temperatures before 1975.

The GIF above animatedly shows the changes in average temperatures. The legend in the bottom represents the differences of average temperature in one year compared to that of last year.

As it shows, temperatures of each country increase annually; in some countries, such as Canada, the extent of increasing temperatures are especially significant.
