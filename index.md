## Changes in Global Temperature

This project is brought to you by Group V. This website hosts graphs and maps that visually represent the changes in global temperature from 1743 to 2013. We seek to demonstrate the extent of global warming and illustrate the seriousness of that problem.

### Global Map <a name="Global Map"></a>

This is a global map that describes the changes in temperatures of all countries in Celcius unit. Temperature changes are generated by subtracting the average global temperatures from 1743 to 1975 from average global temperatures from 1975 to 2013. We choose 1975 to be the threshhold because the idea of global warming was first coined in 1975.

As the map below shows, average global temperatures have raised by a minimum of 0.5 degrees Celcius after 1975.
